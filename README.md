INTRODUCTION

The United States collects and analyzes demographic data from the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau provides annual estimates of the population size of each U.S. state and region. Many important decisions are made using the estimated population dynamics, including the investments in new infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals; establishing new job training centers; opening or closing schools and senior centers; and adjusting the emergency services to the size and characteristics of the demographics of metropolitan and other areas, states, or the country as a whole. The census data and estimates are publicly available on the U.S. census website. Data analysts use a variety of tools to create models for predictions, including models of population dynamics of a state of a region.

For this project, you will use R to create a linear regression model of the population dynamics of your state and predict the size of its population.

The goal is to demonstrate your skill sets with R to support the various stages of the data analytics process.

REQUIREMENTS

A.    Create a linear regression analysis with R to predict the size of the population for the state you live in based on the “Current Estimates Data” dataset. Provide a screenshot of your results.

B.    Explain how you prepared the data from part A and how the dataset was imported into R, including screenshots of your results.

C.    Create an R script that will tabulate a statistical description of the model using R’s summary() function and provide a screenshot of your results.

D.   Predict the population size of your state in five years using a linear regression from part A and provide a screenshot of your results.

E.   Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

F.   Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
